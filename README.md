Thomson Reuters published a rather [abysmal infographic](http://blog.thomsonreuters.com/index.php/mobile-patent-suits-graphic-of-the-day/) showing the "bowl of spaghetti" that is current flurry of patent-related suits in the mobile communications industry. So, inspired by [a comment](https://twitter.com/jfire/status/104008561436270593) by John Firebaugh, I remade the visualization to better convey the network. That company in the center? Yeah, it's the [world's largest](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-08-09/apple-briefly-passes-exxon-as-world-s-largest-company.html), so little wonder it has the most incoming suits.
